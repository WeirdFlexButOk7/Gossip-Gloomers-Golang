# Gossip Gloomers

[Gossip Gloomers](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) is a collection of Distributed Systems challenges by [fly.io](https://fly.io/)

This repo contains my own implementation for these challenges in Golang.

To run these solutions locally, ensure you install [maelstrom](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/releases/tag/v0.2.3) and unpack the tarball in root directory of this repo. Each challenge has `eval.sh` script to test the implementation.
